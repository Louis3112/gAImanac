##  ðŸ¤– :iphone: **gAImanac** ðŸ¤– :iphone:
gAImanac *(prononunced galmanac, not gaymanac)* is an AI Agent designed to assist users in the gaming industry ecosystem (let's just say it is a gaming chatbot AI).

Derived from the words 'Gaming' and 'Almanac', gAImanac aims to be a reliable source information about gaming news, gaming tips, and other gaming-related content .

At this stage, gAImanac is still on conseptual design. It is an idea that popped out for our mid-semester project for software development.
In the future, with enough knowledge, resources, and team. We can make this dream come true.

Tbh, this is my first time using react.js as a framework. 
At first, @rayhan889, @pachyyy, and I created gAImanac only by using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/zOmyobzUCKzkPp2zUuLF9x/UTS-RPL---Chatbot?node-id=0-1&t=mOvA40NX0MpkEbQr-1).

However, when we saw one of my friend has implemented his project as a full website, we decided to take a serious approach.

Since we only have 2 days left, i barely have time to understand how to use a framework (on this moment, i don't know anything about routes, components, let alone state management).

So, I ended up creating the entire main page directly in `App.tsx` -- all at once.

I know this is funny and I can improve it, but i want to save it as a memory.      

Framework i am using are : 
1. React.js for website framework
2. Shadcn/ui for button and avatar component (and yes, i don't know what is component back then). 
3. Tailwind CSS for CSS 

The primary color palette i am using are :
1. #09090B (Zinc - 950)
2. #18181B (Zinc - 900)
3. #27272A (Zinc - 800)
4. #3F3F46 (Zinc - 700)
5. #52525C (Zinc - 600)
5. #FFFFFF (White)
6. #162456 (Blue - 900)
7. #1447E6 (Blue - 700)
8. #016630 (Green - 800)
